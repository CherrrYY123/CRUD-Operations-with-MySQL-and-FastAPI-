# CRUD-Operations-with-MySQL-and-FastAPI-
The project aims to develop an application that performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a MySQL database using Python. It involves implementing wrapper functions for each CRUD operation and integrating them with the FastAPI framework to expose these operations as RESTful APIs.
